Revision history for MooseX-TrackDirty-Attributes

	* Apparently we can no longer rely on $self->name to return a value when
	  called in an attribute builder on an attribute metaclass... Or
	  something.  Don't rely on the builder, but work around and skip related
	  tests until this gets sorted properly -- in any case, trait application
	  during attribute extension or to a metaclass instance are likely to
	  be... atypical.

	* use around, not override, to modify methods; this helps prevent
	  conflicts with other traits [Gianni Ceccarelli]

	* add "cleaner" attribute option to generate an accessor capable of marking
	  an attribute as clean without clearing it

- require Test::Moose::More 0.005+

- "Recreate" the accessor metaclass each time we ask for it...
- ...which means we can drop the v5.10 requirement.
- No code changes since 0.90.

0.90      2011-09-24 22:23:23 America/Los_Angeles
- switch to Dist::Zilla
- use two slots for tracking dirtiness, rather than a base class role and
  additional attribute
- jump to v1, the better to indicate api breakage

0.02     Tue Oct 13 20:13:33 PDT 2009
- switch our attribute option processing from the metaclass trait to the
  attribute metaclass trait
- add initial native attribute helper tracking and tests...  just Hash and
  Array traits properly tracked at the moment.

0.01     Tue Oct  6 21:34:48 PDT 2009 
- First version, released on an (possibly) unsuspecting world.
